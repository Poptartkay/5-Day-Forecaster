### The challenge
​
User Story -
 AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


Acceptance Criteria -

​GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

### What I learned

I learned how to properly utilize and link API's to show correct weather predictions. As well as
how to create a proper weather dashboard. I will admit there were some mild challenges here, but 
overall I feel pretty good about this challenge.

​

​
### Continued development
If there was anything I could differently is I would style the app differently.
(This would just be a personal preference of mine and I might come back to the challenge to do so)
